I"Ô<p>Having a SQL background while learning Python, the first thing I wanted to be able to do was handling a dataset in Python the way I do using T-SQL.
Being comfortable and familiar with Python will take time, but I can start by finding parallels in the way both work with data and maybe feel like I am not stranded out in the wild.</p>

<p>I have already written and article on <a href="">Exploratory Data Analysis with T-SQL</a>, but now I want to do the same using Python and Pandas. 
If you are learning Python and have spent many a night thinking about this (as I might have done), then keep reading.</p>

<p>Typical checks I usually do when I have to work with a dataset (or in my database tables, an actual table or several of those) are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check how the table looks like (first few rows, just to get an idea of how the data is)</li>
  <li>Check how many rows there are</li>
  <li>Check how many of those rows have columns that are null or empty</li>
  <li>Get max, min values (for columns such as timestamps, to get an idea of the timeframe of the data I am working on)</li>
  <li>Check how many rows do I have per entity, are they unique entries, are they not?</li>
</ol>

<p>Letâ€™s load a dataset and try to do exactly these checks in Python using Pandas.</p>

<p>The next post in this series will be <a href="">Exploratory Data Analysis using PySpark and SparkSQL</a>. 
Let me know if you would be interested in that, Iâ€™d be happy to put together a tutorial.</p>
