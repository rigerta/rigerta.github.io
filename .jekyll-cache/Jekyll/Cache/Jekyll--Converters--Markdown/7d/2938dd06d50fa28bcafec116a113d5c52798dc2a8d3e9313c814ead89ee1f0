I"U<p>Learning Python and coming from a SQL background, the first thing I wanted to be able to do was handling a dataset in Python the way I do using T-SQL.
Being comfortable and familiar with Python will take time, but I can start by finding parallels in the way both work with data and maybe feel like I am not stranded out in the wild.</p>
