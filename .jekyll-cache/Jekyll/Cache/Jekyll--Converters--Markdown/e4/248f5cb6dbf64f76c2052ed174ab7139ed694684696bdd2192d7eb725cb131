I"…<p>Welcome to my very first blog post! 
This is going to be a blog on the things that I am curious and passionate about. 
The main goal is for it to be a technical one, focused on the things I either already know and would like to document somewhere, or new things I am learning at the moment.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve recently become very very interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, so naturally you start wondering: How do I begin?
Whatâ€™s the first thing I should do? What do I already know and how can I leverage that, to learn something new?</p>

<p>Exploratory data analysis is the first step in finding a solution to a certain problem in Machine Learning. That is, because of course you would like to see general statistics about your data and get familiar with it, in order to be able to develop any intuition about it.</p>

<p>The journey is a bit long and will be subject to another blog post, but here, I would like to start with performing an exploratory data analysis of a Twitter dataset (end goal is trying it out in Python and PySpark) using T-SQL - which is my favorite color. Wait, did I say color? Hm.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s jump into it.</p>
